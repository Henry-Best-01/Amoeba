# PublicQuasarVariabilityModeling
This repository contains a few examples of my modeling of quasar variability, both intrinsically and extrinsically.

I would like to appologize for the state of this repository. 
I cannot upload a magnification map sample due to size limits. My code was written to use GERLUMPH Microlensing Magnification maps.

If you would like to run the Examples.ipynb notebook, you will be required to change file paths and provide a magnification map as well.
Some Functions, particularly those modelling BLR regions, can be very time consuming due to the amount of calculations done. Time varying convolutions generally require a convolution for every time step provided, which may get very computationally intensive. Please keep these limitations in mind if you do use this code!

Thank you for taking notice of my code! I would be happy to answer any questions.
